# rhythmus-sv

A sampler that pulls audio content randomly from the Freesound API for use in creating rhythms. 

The sequencer will use control voltages in the Eurorack format for generating the rhythms.

Initial proof of concept has been completed using Max and Arduino.

The code provided at the moment is pretty sketchy and needs a lot of work so bear with me!

This is a project that was undertaken as part of my thesis for the Music & Media Technologies post-graduate course at Trinity College, Dublin.

Any thoughts/comments/suggestions would be appreciated.
